# LibraryApp
Logan Library Application(https://thushan98.github.io/Library-App/) is a web-based application that help to manage the library book adding and updating process. It is well user-friendly which is built using Angular. I used Angular, SCSS with BEM rules and angular materials as tech stack.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Project deployed on 'https://thushan98.github.io/Library-App/' 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
